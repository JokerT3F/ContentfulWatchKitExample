# Brew

The Brew app helps find pubs which have craft beer on the menu, be it in kegs or in bottles. Ales, IPAs, double IPAs, porters, stouts – from 4% to 12%, it's all here. Simply put, Brew is like Foursquare for craft beer places.

Currently available in Berlin, San Francisco and New York. [Download it][3] from the App Store.
